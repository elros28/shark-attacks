Simple analisys about sharks attacks using [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks "kaggle.com")

## Questions

### 1) Is the frequency of shark attacks correlated to global warming? :sunny:

### 2) Are certain shark species more prone to attacking? :shark:

### 3) How many reported attacks are lethal? :knife:

### 4) Do sharks have preferences for female or male humans? :woman: :man:

## Results

### 1) Even though one would assume some kind of correlation between the rising temperatures and the number of shark attacks, this data suggests otherwise ([using this dataset for temperatures](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities "kaggle.com")), although you can see a rise in temperatures through the years

### 2) Although the dataset is small, there are certain species that tend to register more attacks, but they aren't nessesarily the ones with more fatalities per incident:

![Species_fatality](img/species-fatality.png?raw=true "Species_fatality")

### 3) From 5690 attacks, only 24.41% were fatal:
